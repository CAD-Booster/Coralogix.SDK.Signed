# Coralogix.SDK.Signed
If you're stuck needing strong-named assemblies, but you still want to use Coralogix, then this package should help you. We have downloaded the official package, signed and published it.

**NuGet Packages**

Official, unsiged version: [Coralogix.SDK](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Coralogix.SDK)<br/>
This package: not released yet

## Caveats
* We do not own the copyright of this code and we are not affiliated with Coralogix in any way. We asked them for a signed version but it wasn't a priority, so we created our own for the time being.
* These are not built from source, we simply get the existing assemblies from NuGet, sign them and publish them back to NuGet.
